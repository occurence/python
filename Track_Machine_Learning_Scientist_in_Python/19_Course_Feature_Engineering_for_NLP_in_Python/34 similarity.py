hopes = "\nBeyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young\nIn a world of magnets and miracles\nOur thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary\nThe ringing of the division bell had begun\nAlong the Long Road and on down the Causeway\nDo they still meet there by the Cut\nThere was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps\nRunning before times took our dreams away\nLeaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground\nTo a life consumed by slow decay\nThe grass was greener\nThe light was brighter\nWhen friends surrounded\nThe nights of wonder\nLooking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us\nTo a glimpse of how green it was on the other side\nSteps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again\nDragged by the force of some in a tide\nAt a higher altitude with flag unfurled\nWe reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world\nEncumbered forever by desire and ambition\nThere's a hunger still unsatisfied\nOur weary eyes still stray to the horizon\nThough down this road we've been so many times\nThe grass was greener\nThe light was brighter\nThe taste was sweeter\nThe nights of wonder\nWith friends surrounded\nThe dawn mist glowing\nThe water flowing\nThe endless river\nForever and ever\n"
hey = "\nHey you, out there in the cold\nGetting lonely, getting old\nCan you feel me?\nHey you, standing in the aisles\nWith itchy feet and fading smiles\nCan you feel me?\nHey you, don't help them to bury the light\nDon't give in without a fight\nHey you out there on your own\nSitting naked by the phone\nWould you touch me?\nHey you with you ear against the wall\nWaiting for someone to call out\nWould you touch me?\nHey you, would you help me to carry the stone?\nOpen your heart, I'm coming home\nBut it was only fantasy\nThe wall was too high\nAs you can see\nNo matter how he tried\nHe could not break free\nAnd the worms ate into his brain\nHey you, out there on the road\nAlways doing what you're told\nCan you help me?\nHey you, out there beyond the wall\nBreaking bottles in the hall\nCan you help me?\nHey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all\nTogether we stand, divided we fall\n"

print("Notice that 'Mother' and 'Hey You' have a similarity score of 0.9 whereas 'Mother' and 'High Hopes' has a score of only 0.6. This is probably because 'Mother' and 'Hey You' were both songs from the same album 'The Wall' and were penned by Roger Waters. On the other hand, 'High Hopes' was a part of the album 'Division Bell' with lyrics by David Gilmour and his wife, Penny Samson. Treat yourself by listening to these songs. They're some of the best!")
